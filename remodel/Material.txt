- light kit ($20-$50)
My choice:

or low voltage (dimmable)
  house and trim
  3" for low ceiling, concentrate illumination
  5" for general light (the living room), even illumination

  a. open trim ( least expensive)
  b. baffles trim (minimizing glare)
  c. Reflectors (maximize light output)
  d. lensed trim (betterlook), used above shower.
  e. decorative trim.
