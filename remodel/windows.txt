Here is my windows and door measurement, please see attached pdf file for how I took the measurement (the interior dimension of existing frame). You can subtract standard 3/8" for the final size on width and height. I did not do the subtraction. 

Overall, I need to replace 11 windows, and 1 sliding door. And add one new Garden window, and one out-swing French door. My budget is tight (around $3500). Can you please give me the best quote based on your sale now ? (maximizing the quality of the material). I only need the material since my contractor can install them for me.  Many thanks!
